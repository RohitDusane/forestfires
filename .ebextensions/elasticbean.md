# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

`Elastic Beanstalk` is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in the cloud. It handles infrastructure tasks such as provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring, so you can focus on writing code.

### 1. Prepare Your Application
Make sure your app is ready for deployment. It could be a web application built with any supported language like Python, Flsk,HTML,NOdejs.

### 2. Install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI
To interact with Elastic Beanstalk from the command line, install the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI).

- Install EB CLI: AWS documentation for EB CLI installation

- Configure AWS CLI: If you havenâ€™t done so, make sure to configure your AWS CLI with your credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

### 3. Initialize Your Elastic Beanstalk Environment
Navigate to your application directory, and initialize the Elastic Beanstalk environment using the EB CLI:
```bash
eb init
```

### 4. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment
After initializing your app, you can create an environment and deploy it:
```bash
eb create my-environment
```
Replace my-environment with a name you prefer. The EB CLI will create the necessary AWS resources like EC2 instances, load balancers, etc.

### 5. Deploy Your Application
Once your environment is set up, deploy your app using:
```bash
eb deploy
```
This will upload your app and start it in the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

### 6. Access Your Application
After deployment, you can access your application:
```bash
eb open
```
This will open your app in the default web browser.

### 7. Monitor and Manage Your Application
You can manage your Elastic Beanstalk environment via the EB CLI or the AWS Management Console.

Check the environment health:
```bash
eb health
eb logs       # to view logs
```
